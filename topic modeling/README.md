# Topic Modeling using LDA

## Overview

Topic modeling is a technique used to discover abstract topics within a collection of documents. 
In this project, we employed Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a popular topic modeling algorithm, to extract topics from text data.

## Dataset

We utilized the 20 Newsgroups dataset from the sklearn library. This dataset consists of approximately 20,000 newsgroup documents, spanning 20 different topics.

## 

- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries:
  - sklearn: for dataset loading and preprocessing
  - gensim: for implementing the LDA algorithm
  - matplotlib, seaborn: for data visualization
  - pandas: for data manipulation and analysis
