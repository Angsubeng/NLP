# Topic Modeling using LDA

## Overview

Topic modeling is a technique used to discover abstract topics within a collection of documents. 
In this project, we employed Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a popular topic modeling algorithm, to extract topics from text data.

## Dataset

We utilized the 20 Newsgroups dataset from the sklearn library. This dataset consists of approximately 20,000 newsgroup documents, spanning 20 different topics.
