# Text Summarization using Attention and TextRank

## Overview

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks for text summarization using two different approaches: attention mechanism and TextRank algorithm.

- The attention mechanism focuses on assigning weights to different parts of the input text to capture important information for summarization.

- TextRank is a graph-based algorithm that identifies important sentences in a document based on their relationships with other sentences.
