# Sentiment Analysis Project

This project explores sentiment analysis, a natural language processing (NLP) task that involves determining whether a piece of text expresses positive or negative sentiment. It can be applied to various forms of text data such as movie reviews, product reviews, social media posts, and more.

## Project Goals

The goal of this project is to develop models that classify the sentiment of text data. Key tasks include:

- Developing a model to classify sentiment of movie reviews using the IMDB dataset
- Developing a model to classify sentiment of Korean movie reviews using the NSMC (Naver Sentiment Movie Corpus) dataset

## Project File Structure

- **IMDB Sentiment Classification.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook that uses the IMDB dataset and employs a GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) model for sentiment classification.
- **NSMC Sentiment Analysis and Prediction.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook that uses the NSMC dataset and employs an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model for sentiment analysis and prediction.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
- Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
